Animation
Xamarin.Forms includes its own animation infrastructure that's straightforward for creating simple animations, while also being versatile enough to create complex animations.

BoxView
The BoxView is just a simple colored rectangle, but it can be used for decorative items, rudimentary graphics, and for obtaining interative touch input.

Button
The Button responds to a tap or click that directs an application to carry out a particular task.

CollectionView
The CollectionView is a flexible and performant view for presenting lists of data using different layout specifications.

Colors
Defining and using colors across platforms can be tricky when each platform has its own standards and defaults.

Controls Reference
This document is a quick reference to the UI views that make up the Xamarin.Forms framework, such as Pages, Layouts, Views and Cells.

DataPages
DataPages provide an API to quickly and easily bind a data source to pre-built views. List items and detail pages will automatically render the data, and be customized using themes.

DatePicker
The DatePicker allows a user to select a date within a specified range. It is implemented using the date picker supported by the particular platform that the application is run on.
